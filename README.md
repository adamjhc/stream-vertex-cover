# Stream Vertex Cover

This project aims to provide implementations for parameterized streaming algorithms for vertex cover as posed in [Chitnis, Cormode, Hajiaghayi, & Monemizadeh, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0093) as well as to provide a basis for further work into parameterized streaming algorithms.

In this project you will find

- Basic implementations for small graphs using [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/)
- Stream implementations using Python `IO`
- Stream implementations using [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Faust](http://faust.readthedocs.io/)
- Visualisations of algorithms
- Runtime analysis and memory profiling

All code is statically type checked using [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/). View the [docs](https://stream-vertex-cover.readthedocs.io/)

## Backstory

This was my undergraduate final year project while studying at the University of Birmingham. Towards the end of the first term and through the December break I suffered from glandular fever for 6-7 weeks.
