# Labelled Edge lists

This directory contains labelled Edge lists. These follow a format of:

```text
<number of nodes> <number of edges>
u v
u v
u v
...
```

"Labelled" in this case meaning an edge list prepended by the number of nodes and edges. In the case where we can store a graph in a file, useful takeaways can be made from simply knowing the number of nodes and edges without processing the entire graph.
