\section{Related Work}

The work in this paper is heavily inspired by two papers, ``Parameterized
Streaming: Maximal Matching and Vertex Cover'' \cite{chitnis2015parameterized}
and ``Towards a Theory of Parameterized Streaming Algorithms''
\cite{chitnis2019towards}. The first paper laid the groundwork for
parameterized streaming algorithms in 2015, showing the first streaming
algorithms for \(k\)-Vertex Cover. They considered insertion-only, dynamic, and
dynamic-promised stream models and delivered results for each.

The second paper builds on the first, focusing on space complexity of
parameterized streaming algorithms. They find general lower bounds for space
complexity of parameterized streaming algorithms for a number of problems.
