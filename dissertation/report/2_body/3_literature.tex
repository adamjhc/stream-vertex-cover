\section{Related Work}

Two papers, ``Parameterized Streaming: Maximal Matching and Vertex Cover''
\cite{chitnis2015parameterized} and ``Towards a Theory of Parameterized
Streaming Algorithms'' \cite{chitnis2019towards}, heavily inspired the work in
this paper.

The first paper laid the groundwork for parameterized streaming
algorithms in 2015, showing the first streaming algorithms for \(k\)-Vertex
Cover. They considered insertion-only, dynamic, and dynamic-promised stream
models and delivered results for each.

The second paper builds on the first, focusing on the space complexity of
parameterized streaming algorithms, and finding general lower bounds for space
complexity for several problems.
