\section{Conclusion}

Vertex Cover is a classical graph-theoretic problem that lends well to modern
research into parameterized complexity which, in turn, is a perfect environment
to use with streaming algorithms. This paper covered two types of streaming
algorithms for solving \(k\)-Vertex Cover, which were shown to be better
performing in both time and space compared to their classical counterparts. In
building a foundation for further work to be built upon, we created
visualisations of the algorithms and implemented them into a production-ready
streaming platform. Our work invites others to continue this foundation that we
have created here.
