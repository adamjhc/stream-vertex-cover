\section*{Abstract}

With the size of datasets growing in the order of magnitudes, there has been a
greater demand for techniques to process the data. Streaming algorithms have
been shown to be a strong contender in the quest to tackle this. While datasets
have been growing, many of the classical problems questioned about these
datasets have not changed, and neither has the order of their output size. This
gives us a perfect environment to take advantage of parameterized complexity.
Vertex Cover is one such classical problem that has had parameterized streaming
algorithms developed for it in recent years. Yet, many of these algorithms have
not been implemented and tested on real-world datasets.

This paper aims to build a base on which to implement parameterized graph
streaming algorithms and to provide aids in the understanding of how these
algorithms work. We provide as-is implementations from previous work as well as
optimised implementations, visualisations, performance profiling, and a
proof-of-concept streaming platform. Altogether, we believe our work provides
all the tools needed to further development in this class of algorithms.
