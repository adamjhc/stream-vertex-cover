\section{Discussion}

basically other stuff I could continue this project with

If I had more time I would look into

\begin{itemize}
    \item
          expanding the proof-of-concept into a full platform
    \item
          expanding it to more algorithms
    \item
          how the algorithms can be parallelized for greater performance
\end{itemize}
