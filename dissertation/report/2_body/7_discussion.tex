\section{Discussion}

We believe the tools we have created here will help in continuing and bringing
new research into this area of study. The work has been purposely presented so
that another group can pick this up and continue. Topics to continue with would
be: expanding the stream implementation into a fully-fledged platform as
mentioned above, looking into more general streaming models such as
insertion-deletion, and expanding the range of algorithms to include those that
take advantage of parallelisation.
