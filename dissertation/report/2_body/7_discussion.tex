\section{Discussion}

basically other stuff I could continue this project with

If I had more time I would look into

\begin{itemize}
    \item
          expanding the proof-of-concept into a full platform
    \item
          expanding it to more algorithms
    \item
          how the algorithms can be parallelized for greater performance
    \item
          Maybe consider VC itself, but for more general (and more practical)
          streaming models such as insertion-deletion
\end{itemize}

Have a strong conclusion and Discussion please. This is usually read in detail
